# Pre-Class Drills - JavaScript


### 1. Write a function that takes in two numbers and outputs the max (the greater of the two numbers).
```
Ex: 
Input: 1, 2
Output: 2

Input: 6, -4
Output: 6

Input: 3.4, 2
Output: 3.4
``` 

* Start with the function expression, write the function and test it out with the sample inputs and outputs provided: 

```js
  var max = function(num1, num2){

  };
```


### 2. Write a function that takes in an integer and outputs the sum of all the numbers from 1 to that integer.
```
Ex: 
Input: 2
Output: 3 (because 1 + 2 = 3)

Input: 4
Output: 10  (because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10)

Input: 10
Output: 55
```


### 3. Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and outputs the maximum number.
```
Ex: 
Input: [ 1, 2, 3 ]
Output: 3

Input: [ 3, 6, 4, 5, 2, 1 ]
Output: 6

Input: [ 3, 3, 3 ]
Output: 3
```


### 4. Write a function that takes in a string and outputs the number of vowels (not counting y).
```
Ex:
Input: "hello"
Output: 2

Input: "you are great!"
Output: 6

Input: "why?"
Output: 0
```


### 5. Write a function that takes in a single word as a string and returns true if itâ€™s a palindrome and false otherwise (a palindrome is spelled the same way forwards and backwards).
```
Ex:
Input: "noon"
Output: true

Input: "horse"
Output: false

Input: "racecar"
Output: true
```
