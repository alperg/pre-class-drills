# Pre-Class Drills - JavaScript


### Write a function that takes in two numbers and outputs the max (the greater of the two numbers).
```
Ex: 
Input: 1, 2
Output: 2

Input: 6, -4
Output: 6

Input: 3.4, 2
Output: 3.4

``` 

* Start with the function expression, write the function and test it out with the sample inputs and outputs provided: 

```js
  var max = function(num1, num2){

  }
```

### Write a function that takes in an integer and outputs the sum of all the numbers from 1 to that integer.

```
Ex: 
Input: 2
Output: 3 (because 1 + 2 = 3)

Input: 4
Output: 10  (because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10)

Input: 10
Output: 55
```
